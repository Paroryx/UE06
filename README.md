# Software Development Exercises - UE06  

## 📜 Tasks  
This exercise focuses on various programming tasks involving recursion, array operations, text conversion, and object-oriented programming with factories and machines.  

### 1. Recursive Array Minimum  
Develop a recursive method to find the minimum value in a given array.  
- **Program:** `ArrMin.java`  

### 2. Numbers to Text  
Convert numbers into their text representation.  
- **Program:** `JavalandNumber.java` and `NumbersToText.java`  

### 3. Factory and Machines  
Simulate a factory with multiple machines, each producing products at a specified rate.  
- **Classes:**  
  - `Machine.java`: Represents a machine in the factory.  
  - `Factory.java`: Manages multiple machines.  
  - `Company.java`: Simulates factory operations and calculates service costs.
